# CIT325
Class CIT325 Database Programming (Oracle) PL/SQL
This Database Programming class is a class that in my opinion is very poorly structured.
I HAVE studied BYUI for 2 years now and I found all the classes great until I got to this one.

The instructions and requirements are very vague and difficult to understand.

They send you to do exercises without even explaining the structure of the database schema. The previous class worked with MySQL, and there are commands that are not compatible and that is something to be expected, but in the material it should be explained.

The teachers are another issue, I saw the subject twice, the first teacher was very demanding, the truth was he exaggerated, he always had an excuse to take points away, one week I got 24/25, because according to him everything was perfect but one thing I did in three lines could be done in one. The other teacher takes too long to correct the tasks, he does not upload the videos on time, they are videos where the necessary ones to complete the tasks of the week are explained, he uploads them two weeks later and I am not kidding.

For all this, he created this repository to help others who are dissatisfied.

There is another repository from another student but it is older, I see that what the university changes are the directories where certain scripts are, so be careful with that.

Not all the labs are perfect, the one for week 11 doesn't work well, for example, but I think everything will be of great help.
